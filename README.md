# Cypress_Main_Assignment

In this I have used Cypress to automate the Shopping website 
Implemented PageObject Model covered all the test cases mentiones in the Assignment document

I have configured the cypress.cofig.js with environment variables and added Mochaawesome plugin to generate reports
And I have configured the No.of retries i.e, if a test case fails due to slow internet or some other reasons it will try to re-run the test case for a specified number of times
Can run in both head and headless mode

Generated Mochawesomw reports which includes the screenrecording of the each test case implemention and screenshot of the failure test case
